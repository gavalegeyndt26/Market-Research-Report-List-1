<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unmanned Underwater Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AUV</li><li>ROV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) market consists primarily of two types: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). AUVs operate independently to collect data and perform tasks, making them ideal for deep-sea exploration and underwater surveys without real-time human control. In contrast, ROVs are tethered to a surface vessel and controlled by operators, allowing for direct manipulation in complex underwater environments, such as underwater inspections, maintenance, and salvage operations. Both play critical roles in marine research and industry.</p></p>
