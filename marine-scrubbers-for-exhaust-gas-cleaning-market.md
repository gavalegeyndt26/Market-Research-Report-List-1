<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Scrubbers for Exhaust Gas Cleaning Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine scrubbers are exhaust gas cleaning systems used to reduce emissions from ships. Open loop scrubbers utilize seawater to wash away pollutants, discharging the treated water back into the ocean. They are effective in areas with ample seawater availability and favorable environmental conditions. Closed loop scrubbers, on the other hand, use freshwater mixed with alkaline substances, recirculating the water to minimize waste discharge. This system is more versatile and can be employed in various waters, including areas with stricter regulations.</p></p>
