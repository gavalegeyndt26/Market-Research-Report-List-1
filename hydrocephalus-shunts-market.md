<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrocephalus Shunts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Valves</li><li>Monopressure Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydrocephalus shunts market is primarily categorized into adjustable valves and monopressure valves. Adjustable valves allow clinicians to modify the pressure settings post-implantation, providing customized treatment for patients with varying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. Monopressure valves, on the other hand, maintain a fixed pressure level for CSF drainage, simplifying the device's function but limiting adaptability. Both types serve crucial roles in managing hydrocephalus by directing excess CSF away from the brain, thereby preventing complications associated with elevated intracranial pressure.</p></p>
